My purposes: I really want to learn how to program in JavaScript. I like the process of solving tasks and creating projects,
as well as bonuses provided by the it sphere. At the moment, the main goal is to get a base for development in JS,
in the future, I plan to finish another course on frameworks and start looking for a job as a developer.
About me: I am active, initiative, but plodding, I learn quickly, I love everything new, I like to work in a team.
Education and work experience: I graduated from Francisk Skorina Gomel State University as an accountant. After graduation, I worked as a chief accountant for a year and a half,
and then went to support the 1C 8 program. Recently, I myself mastered programming 1C8 (OOP) and started working at the same time
as the programmer (the last six months).
